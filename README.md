# Machine-Learning
This repository has some of my machine learning projects.

# Resnet
This is the machine learning algorithm which I made to get hands on experience with machine learning. This model is the basic image classification model.

# Architecture
The architecture of the model uses the convolution neural network and its architecture is shown as follows:
